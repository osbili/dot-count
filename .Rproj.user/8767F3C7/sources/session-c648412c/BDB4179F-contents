# I downloaded Quartz to be able to opearate imager on macOS - https://www.xquartz.org/

# Images need to be photographed close, capturing all flies.
# Images need to be in jpg format.

## install library EBImage 

```{r}
library(EBImage)
```


#Change the working directory and name of the image in the below chunk
```{r}
#| label: Load the image
image <- readImage("/Users/can/Desktop/dot count/test1.jpg")
display(image, method = "raster")  # Display the original image
```

```{r}
#| label: Convert to grayscale
gray_image <- channel(image, "gray")
display(gray_image, method = "raster")  # Display the grayscale image
```

```{r}
#| label: Outlying the flies
bw_image <- thresh(gray_image, w = 15, h = 15, offset = 0.04)  # Adaptive thresholding
display(bw_image, method = "raster")  # Display the binary image
```


```{r}
#| label: Converting flies into dots

cleaned_image <- opening(bw_image, makeBrush(9, shape = 'disc'))
display(cleaned_image, method = "raster")
```

```{r}
#| label: Colour coding (Suggested)
labeled_image <- bwlabel(cleaned_image)
display(colorLabels(labeled_image), method = "raster")
```


```{r}
#| label: Count and print number of flies
number_of_flies <- max(labeled_image)
print(paste("Number of flies:", number_of_flies))
```
